# One-time Kubernetes Crossplane Setup
## Introduction
This setup process is performed once before running OCI examples.

## Prerequisites
- kubectl is connected to a Kubernetes cluster
- Terraform
- Helm
- Go and goimports

## Set Up
### Install Crossplane
It is assumed that the user is using Rancher Desktop, Docker Desktop, or some other locally running Kubernetes implementation.

1. Install Crossplane.
```
helm repo add crossplane-stable https://charts.crossplane.io/stable && helm repo update
helm install crossplane --namespace crossplane-system --create-namespace crossplane-stable/crossplane 
```
1. Clone the Crossplane repository.
```
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane.git
```
1. Apply cluster Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
```
kubectl apply -f crossplane/cluster/crds
```
### Install OCI Provider
1. Clone the Crossplane repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/oracle-samples/crossplane-provider-oci.git
cd crossplane-provider-oci
```
1. Copy `examples/providerconfig/secret.yaml.tmpl` to `secret.yaml` and modify its contents for your environment.
1. Install the OCI Crossplane provider:
```
kubectl apply -f examples/providerconfig/secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f package/crds
kubectl apply -f examples/providerconfig/providerconfig.yaml
```

1. For examples of composite resources, install role binding for the locally running Kubernetes `crossplane-system` account.
```
kubectl apply -f examples/oke_sample/crossplane-cluster-role-binding.yml
```
    **Note: This step is used for locally running Kubernetes instances, such as in this demo and will install role binding and maps for the Kubernetes dashboard user.**
1. Start the local OCI Crossplane provider.
```
make run
```

## Validation

### Validate Crossplane
Check that the pods are running.
```
$ kubectl get pods -n crossplane-system
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS         AGE
crossplane-rbac-manager-54f9cb8f89-fvk6z   1/1     Running   15 (6m29s ago)   24h
crossplane-5845f4c9c-xgfn4                 1/1     Running   14 (5m50s ago)   24h
```
### Validate OCI provider
Check OCI Provider is running by doing your first example.

#### Object Storage Bucket Example
1. Edit examples/objectstorage/bucket.yaml with your compartment and Object Storage name space.
1. Apply the bucket resource.
```
$ kubectl apply -f  examples/objectstorage/bucket.yaml
```
1. Confirm managed resource `bucket-via-crossplane4` is READY using the command below.

**Note**: You may need to invoke the command multiple times until Crossplane successfully syncs with the Oracle Cloud resource state.
```
$ kubectl get managed | grep bucket-via-crossplane4 -B 1
NAME                                                         READY   SYNCED   EXTERNAL-NAME              AGE
bucket.objectstorage.oci.upbound.io/bucket-via-crossplane4   True    True     n/idimd1fghobk/b/bucket1   10m
```

### Useful commands
- Check Crossplane created managed resource states.
    ```
    kubectl get managed
    ```
- Describe applied resource
    ```
    kubectl describe <kind> <name>`
    ```
