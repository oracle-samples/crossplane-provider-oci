                      A protection mode of HSM means that the key persists on a hardware
                      security module (HSM) and all cryptographic operations are performed
                      inside the HSM. A protection mode of SOFTWARE means that the
                      key persists on the server, protected by the vault's RSA wrapping
                      key which persists on the HSM. All cryptographic operations
                      that use a key with a protection mode of SOFTWARE are performed
                      on the server. By default, a key's protection mode is set to
                      HSM. You can't change a key's protection mode after the key
                      is created or imported. A protection mode of EXTERNAL mean that
                      the key persists on the customer's external key manager which
                      is hosted externally outside of oracle. Oracle only hold a reference
                      to that key. All cryptographic operations that use a key with
                      a protection mode of EXTERNAL are performed by external key
                      manager.

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                      A protection mode of HSM means that the key persists on a hardware
                      security module (HSM) and all cryptographic operations are performed
                      inside the HSM. A protection mode of SOFTWARE means that the

                      key which persists on the HSM. All cryptographic operations
                      that use a key with a protection mode of SOFTWARE are performed
                      on the server. By default, a key's protection mode is set to
                      HSM. You can't change a key's protection mode after the key
                      is created or imported. A protection mode of EXTERNAL mean that
                      the key persists on the customer's external key manager which
                      is hosted externally outside of oracle. Oracle only hold a reference
                      to that key. All cryptographic operations that use a key with
                      a protection mode of EXTERNAL are performed by external key
                      manager.
