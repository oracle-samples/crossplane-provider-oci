                            content expires. No enforcement mechanism exists at this
                            time, but audit logs record the expiration on the appropriate
                            date, according to the time interval specified in the
                            rule. The timer resets after you update the secret contents.
                            The minimum value is 1 day and the maximum value is 90
                            days for this property. Currently, only intervals expressed
                            in days are supported. For example, pass P3D to have the
