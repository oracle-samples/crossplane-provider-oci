                      that read the object determine what to do based on the value
                      provided. For example, you could use this header to identify

                      Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what

                      that read the object determine what to do based on the value
                      provided. For example, you could use this header to identify

                        ObservedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
