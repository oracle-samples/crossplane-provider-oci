                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,

                  This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
                  PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting
                  each other.
