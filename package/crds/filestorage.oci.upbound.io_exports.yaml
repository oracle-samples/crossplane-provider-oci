                      used to determine a list of secondary groups then an empty secondary
                      group list is used for authorization. If the number of groups

                      is truncated to the first 256 groups read.

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                      within an NFS request's RPC header. When this flag is true the
                      Unix UID from the RPC header is used to retrieve the list of
                      secondary groups from a the ID mapping subsystem. The primary
                      GID is always taken from the RPC header. If ID mapping is not
                      configured, incorrectly configured, unavailable, or cannot be
                      used to determine a list of secondary groups then an empty secondary
                      group list is used for authorization. If the number of groups
                      exceeds the limit of 256 groups, the list retrieved from LDAP
                      is truncated to the first 256 groups read.
